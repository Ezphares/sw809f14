The focus of the project is making a system allowing two runners to run against each other disregarding physical location and with fair matching. \\
The system is designed with a competitive focus, and this will be detailed in the report. \\
The different parts of the system include a smartphone application for the Android platform, a website implementation for making routes and a match server for matching two runners.
