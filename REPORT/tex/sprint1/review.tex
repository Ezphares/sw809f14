\section{Review}
\label{sprint1-review}

As described in \autoref{sec:sprint1-tasks}, four tasks had been chosen for the first sprint. The status of these can be seen in \autoref{fig:sprint1-status}. As can be seen, a single task was not completed, and some changes were needed for another. These will be planned for a later sprint. The learning curve of the Android framework will be taken into account when planning the amount of work to be done in later sprints.

  \hline
  Task & Status \\
  \hline
  Phone App & \pbox{8cm}{Task done, but learning the Android framework\\ took more time than expected.} \\
  \hline
  Route Planning & Task done, but will need a better user interface. \\
  \hline
  Ranking & Task done. \\
  \hline
  \ac{GPS} & Task not done. \\

All in all, we considered the first sprint a success and a learning experience, which gave us a better idea of how to approach Android development, as well as determining the skill of players.
