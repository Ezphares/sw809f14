\section{Review}
\label{sec:sprint1-review}

As described in \autoref{sec:sprint1-tasks}, four tasks had been chosen for the first sprint. The status of these can be seen in \autoref{fig:sprint1-status}. As can be seen, a single task was not completed, and some changes were needed for another. These will be planned for a later sprint. The learning curve of the Android framework will be taken into account when planning the amount of work to be done in later sprints.

		Mobile App & Task done, but learning the Android framework took more time than expected. \\

		Route Planning & Task done, but will need a better user interface. \\
		\hline
		Ranking & Task done. \\

		\ac{GPS} & Task not done. \\

All in all, we considered the first sprint a success and a learning experience, which gave us a better idea of how to approach Android development, as well as determining the skill of players.

After this sprint the Vision for the project was reviewed, however it was determined that there was no need to update the use context or the Vision.
