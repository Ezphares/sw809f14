\section{RunOff Application}
For the first sprint it was decided the focus should be on creating a very basic application prototype which could showcase the envisioned \ac{GUI} functionality and be able to interface with the server. 

\subsection{Tools}
For development Android Studio, an \ac{IDE} developed by Google Inc. which is specifically designed to support Android application development, was chosen. Android Studio is currently in "early preview" mode, which means it is still under heavy development, however the group decided that it should be the first choice for development, given that it is developed by Google Inc. specifically with the Android OS in mind.  

\subsection{User Interface}
At its core the application is intended to be quick and easy to use - the user should open the application, choose a running mode (against friends or against an unknown opponent) and start searching for a match.
