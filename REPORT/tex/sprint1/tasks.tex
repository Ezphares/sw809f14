\label{sec:sprint1-tasks}

For the first sprint we decided to start with some of the fundamental functionality that would be needed by several other desired features. Our choice was the following functionality:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{A skeleton for the phone application.}
	\item{Route planning, including saving and retrieving.}
	\item{A system for ranking users.}
	\item{Access to \ac{GPS} tracking data on the phone.}
\end{itemize}

Before these tasks could be started a few group decisions had to be made. The biggest of these decisions was for which phone platform the application should be developed. We quickly decided to use Android, as the entire group had experience with using the phone, and we had access to several Android phones which would make testing easier.

Another decision was reached, that the route planning system should be accessed on a web page, and routes stored in a central database. This decision was made for two primary reasons: First, we thought it would be easier to create and edit routes on a map using a mouse rather than a touch interface. Second, we wanted to store the routes in a central database anyway, as we want users to have access to all their routes from any compatible device they own.
