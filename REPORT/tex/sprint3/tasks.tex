\section{Tasks}
\label{sec:sprint3-tasks}

For the third sprint, three tasks were planned. The planned work effort for this sprint was slightly lower than previous sprints, because, as mentioned in \autoref{sec:sprint2-review}, the \ac{GPS} tracking was starting to become an issue so we needed to make sure that task was completed.

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\ac{GPS} tracking.}
	\item{Match communication protocol.}
	\item{Route Tracking.}
\end{itemize}

Apart from the \ac{GPS} tracking, a communication protocol between the mobile application and the match server was planned. This was a natural step, as it was one of the options considered for the second sprint, as described in \autoref{sec:sprint2-tasks}.

The final task planned was ``Route Tracking''. This covers being able to check coordinates received from participants of a race against the route they are running to see if they are going off-route. This is one of several necessary features to make cheating harder to accomplish.
