This sprint was considered a success. All tasks were completed, even the recurring \ac{GPS} tracking task. This meant that at this point the fundamental features were done.

Reviewing the Essence prototype configuration the group realized that in order to match the use context described the focus on social features was superfluous as the core idea is competition against strangers. Thus it was decided that no future development of social features should be planned.
