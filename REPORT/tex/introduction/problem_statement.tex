\section{Problem Statement}
With the vision described in \autoref{sec:problem-exp} the group arrived at the following problem statement: 

We want to enable any person from anywhere on the globe at any time of day to find an opponent of roughly equal skill and run a race against them in real time. 

Today there are no consumer solutions on the market that allow two users to compete in real time without requiring them to be at a certain location at a designated time and there are no guarantees about the equality of skill level of the participants.

We will solve this problem by creating a proof of concept product that allows two users of equal skill to connect using a smartphone application and track each other during their race in real time.
