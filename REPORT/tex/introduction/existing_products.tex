\section{Existing Products}
Several products aimed at helping people keeping up an exercise regimen already exist, with varying focus. In this section the popular smartphone and website products ``RunKeeper'' and ``Zombies, Run!'' are examined. 

\subsection{RunKeeper}
The application RunKeeper combines a mobile client with an online website and keeps track of workouts, personal records and goals. It utilizes gamification, the act of putting game elements into a non-game product, to good effect by implementing rankings between friends based on the number of workouts logged that month, a variety of achievements for breaking personal records and live tracking of one's activity so friends and family can follow one's workout in real time. The basic application and an online profile is free and a premium version is available for a fee. RunKeeper also offers workout plans such as a \ac{C25K} plan that, if followed, should enable the user to run a 5 kilometre race. The site utilizes an activity feed similar to Facebook, with updates from friends about workouts and the option of commenting and liking the update. 

The RunKeeper application has most of the functionality of the website which means you can exclusively use either one without the other. While this is practical for some users it means that a user with an older smartphone can have problems running the application because of its high resource use. The gamification of the activities is quite well done. The focus is mostly on a social, friend-based application which motivates users through friendly competition and reminders to work out after periods of inactivity. There is no option to race against another person and the achievements are purely based on personal records. The ranking system only ranks the user among their friends. While competing against friends is attractive to many people some more competitively inclined users, or very skilled athletes, might not have any use of this, save for showing off physical prowess.

Attractive features of RunKeeper include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Achievements}
	\item{Scoreboard}
	\item{Personal goals}
	\item{Workout reminders}
	\item{Extensive logging}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Zombies, Run!}
Zombies, Run! is a gamified application targeted towards runners. The application takes the form of an audio drama with the user as the main character. During a workout the user listens to their own playlist of music interleaved with sound clips telling the story of the township of Abel after a zombie apocalypse. and the adventures of the main character known as ``Runner 5''. Interval training, called ``zombie chases'', can be switched on or off before a workout starts. While the user runs random items are collected which can be used in a small in-application game which revolves around the design and expansion of Abel from a tiny settlement to a larger township. The application can be connected to fitness trackers like RunKeeper to allow the user to track their runs while listening to the story of Runner 5 during their workout. \ac{GPS} tracking is available and is, among other things, used to determine if the user speeds up during the zombie chases. An accelerometer tracking option is also available, counting the number of steps a user takes during a run.

Zombies, Run! relies on integration with other trackers to provide social aspects. There is no option to run with friends. The application uses achievements and a mini-game to motivate the user. The focus is on one person but with the option to include social aspects through the aforementioned integration. There is minimal tracking: number of completed missions (runs), distance, time and items collected.

	\item{Audio motivation/feedback}
	\item{Focus on personal improvement}
	\item{No innate social aspect}
