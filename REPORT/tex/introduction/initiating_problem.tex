\section{Initiating Problem}
In today's society most people do not get the amount of exercise the general health recommendations prescribe. Overall our society is becoming more and more sedentary, especially in the work place and with transportation. This means people have to make a conscious choice to be active and for many this is not a priority. After New Years many fitness centres see an influx of new members who then drop off after a few weeks when the initial motivation tapers off. The problem of lacking motivation for exercising is the initiating problem for this project.
