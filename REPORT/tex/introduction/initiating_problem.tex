\section{Initiating Problem}
\label{sec:initiating}
In today's society many people do not get the amount of exercise the general health recommendations prescribe. Overall our society has become more and more sedentary over time, especially in the workplace. This means people have to make a conscious choice to be active and for many this is not a priority. After New Year's Eve many fitness centres see an influx of new members who then drop off after a few weeks when the initial motivation tapers off. The problem of lacking motivation for exercising is the initiating problem for this project.
