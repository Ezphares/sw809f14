\section{Conclusion}
In the problem statement in \autoref{sec:problem-statement} we stated that we wanted to create a proof-of-concept product that allows two users of equal skill to connect using a smartphone application and track each other during their race in real time 

In the project we have created a system that allows a user to plot in a route, match up against an opponent of roughly equal rating and run a race against them. The system checks that each person stays on their route and displays two markers on each runner's smartphone indicating the position of the user and the opponent, relative to the user's route. The system can determine who reaches the end of their route first and announce a winner and adjust the participants' ratings accordingly. 

This was what the team originally set out to do, so the project is considered a success.
