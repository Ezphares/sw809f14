\section{Known Limitations}
Given that this is a proof-of-concept there are certain limitations to the implementation.

\begin{itemize}
\item If the user loses connection with the server during a race the other participant is not informed that a disconnect has happened.
\item It is not possible to use the application without logging in. Closing the application without logging in requires the user to press the home button, which means the application will continue running in the background.
\item If there is not Internet connection when logging in the application crashes when the user tries to retrieve their routes. In general there are a number of unhandled exceptions that can potentially crash the application.
\item The activity lifecycle on the Android system is currently not handled properly. This should be remedied by adding functionality to handle all stages.
\item The feedback in the application is currently mostly toasts, however depending on the user's settings the device may not display these toasts. This can be fixed by creating dialogs instead.
\item Some combinations of messages are currently untested and might cause security issues on the server.
\item There are some unhandled memory leaks. This may have been the cause of a participant's phone turning unresponsive during a test, however the device did not close the socket and we were unable to replicate the error.
\end{itemize}
