\section{Tasks}
\label{sec:sprint4-tasks}

For this sprint, 3 tasks were chosen. The goal of this sprint was to be able to have two users be matched using the phone application and complete a race.

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Application as match client.}
	\item{Match server Communication.}
	\item{Server-side progress tracking.}
\end{itemize}

The first two tasks are actually two sides of the same. The application and the match server should, using the communications protocol be able to initiate and complete a match, which should include matchmaking according to rating and route length, have the client running their respective routes while tracked by \ac{GPS}, and correctly determining a winner.

The progress tracking was the last piece of functionality that will be used to determine whether users complete their route. The task entailed making sure the server tracks that the participants of a race complete their entire route, reaching each checkpoint in the correct order.
