This report was written as a part of the eighth semester project in the Software Engineering education at Aalborg University. The report is written in parallel with the development of a software system, the process of which this report aims to describe.

The system was developed with an agile method, which is reflected in this report, by having each sprint represented as a chapter.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank our supervisor Ivan Aaen, for providing feedback during the development of the system and the writing of this report, as well as for introducing us to the Essence method of software innovation, which was used with his assistance to provide direction to the project.
